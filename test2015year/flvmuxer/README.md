#flvmuxer
a mux tool for mux H.264 NAL Video Data with ADTS-AAC RAW Audio Data write to a flv file or publish RTMP Server with librtmp 
#How to install ?
1. you must install rtmpdump firstly if you want to publish stream to RTMP Server
2. then `gcc -o  name xiecc_rtmp.c librtmp.a`

If you just want to mux to flv file, There's no need to install rtmpdump.
just run `gcc -o name flv.c`

If it can help you a little,  I'll be glad .
